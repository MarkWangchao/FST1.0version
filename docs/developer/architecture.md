# Architecture Documentation

This document provides an overview of the trading platform's architecture, explaining its components, their interactions, and the design principles behind the system.

## System Overview

The trading platform is designed as a modular, microservices-based system that enables algorithmic trading across various markets. The architecture follows clean code principles, separation of concerns, and is built for scalability and reliability.

## Core Components

### 1. Web UI

The user interface layer built with React.js that provides:
- Dashboard for monitoring markets and portfolio
- Trading interface
- Strategy configuration
- Account management
- Historical performance analytics

### 2. API Gateway

Serves as the entry point for all client requests, providing:
- Authentication and authorization
- Request routing
- Rate limiting
- API versioning
- Documentation

### 3. Core Engine

The central component that coordinates all trading activities:
- Market data processing and normalization
- Trading logic orchestration
- Event handling and publication
- System state management

### 4. Data Service

Responsible for market data collection, storage, and analysis:
- Real-time market data ingestion
- Historical data storage
- Technical indicators calculation
- Custom data feeds integration

### 5. Strategy Service

Manages trading strategies:
- Strategy registration and lifecycle management
- Backtesting framework
- Strategy performance monitoring
- Parameter optimization

### 6. Trading Service

Handles order management and portfolio tracking:
- Order creation and validation
- Position management
- Risk management
- Portfolio valuation

### 7. Execution Service

Responsible for executing trading decisions:
- Order routing
- Execution algorithms (TWAP, VWAP, etc.)
- Smart order routing
- Trade reconciliation

### 8. Exchange Connectors

Connect to various exchanges and trading venues:
- Standardized API for different exchanges
- Rate limit management
- Error handling and retry logic
- Exchange-specific feature support

### 9. Auth Service

Manages authentication and authorization:
- User registration and management
- API key management
- Role-based access control
- Session management

## Data Flow

1. Market data flows from exchanges through Exchange Connectors to the Data Service
2. Data Service processes and normalizes the data and sends it to the Core Engine
3. Core Engine distributes the data to Strategy Service and relevant subscribers
4. Strategy Service evaluates strategies and sends trading signals to the Core Engine
5. Core Engine validates signals and forwards them to the Trading Service
6. Trading Service creates orders and sends them to the Execution Service
7. Execution Service routes orders to appropriate Exchange Connectors
8. Execution results flow back through the system, updating state in each service

## Database Architecture

The platform uses a combination of database technologies:

- **PostgreSQL**: For relational data (user accounts, orders, trades, configuration)
- **TimescaleDB**: For time-series data (market data, indicators)
- **Redis**: For caching and pub/sub messaging
- **MongoDB**: For flexible document storage (strategy configurations, backtesting results)

## Messaging

The system uses a message-driven architecture with:

- **Kafka**: For durable event streams and message queues
- **Redis Pub/Sub**: For lightweight, transient messaging
- **WebSockets**: For real-time client communication

## Deployment Architecture

The platform can be deployed in various configurations:

- **Local Development**: Docker Compose with all services
- **Testing Environment**: Kubernetes cluster with replicated services
- **Production**: Multi-region Kubernetes deployment with high availability

## Scalability and Performance

The architecture supports horizontal scaling through:

- Stateless microservices
- Message-based communication
- Database sharding
- Read replicas for heavy read loads
- Caching strategies

## Security Architecture

Security is built into every level:

- HTTPS/TLS for all external communication
- JWT-based authentication
- API keys with fine-grained permissions
- Network segmentation
- Secrets management
- Regular security audits

## Fault Tolerance and Resilience

The system is designed to be resilient through:

- Circuit breakers
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation
- Service health monitoring
- Automatic failover
- Comprehensive error handling

## Monitoring and Observability

The platform includes:

- Distributed tracing (Jaeger)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus)
- Centralized logging (ELK stack)
- Alerting system
- Performance dashboards (Grafana)

## Development Principles

The codebase follows these principles:

- Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Domain-driven design
- Test-driven development
- Continuous integration and deployment
- Comprehensive documentation
- Code reviews and quality standards
