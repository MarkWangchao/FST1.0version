## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to uphold our Code of Conduct, which ensures a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/trading-platform.git
cd trading-platform
```

### 3. Set Up Development Environment

Follow the instructions in the [Setup Guide](setup.md) to set up your development environment.

### 4. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the changes you're making.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Understanding the Codebase

Before making changes, take some time to understand the project structure and architecture:

- Review the [Architecture Documentation](architecture.md)
- Explore the codebase to understand the components and their interactions
- If you're unsure about anything, ask questions in our community forums or GitHub discussions

### 2. Making Changes

When making changes:

- Follow the coding style and conventions used in the project
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Include appropriate comments where necessary
- Update or add documentation as needed

### 3. Testing Your Changes

Before submitting your changes, ensure they work as expected:

- Write tests for your changes
- Run existing tests to ensure you haven't broken anything
- If applicable, perform manual testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
pytest

# Run linting
flake8
```

### 4. Committing Your Changes

Write clear and descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "Add feature: detailed description of your changes"
```

Follow these guidelines for commit messages:

- Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Start with a capital letter
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Include relevant issue numbers if applicable (e.g., "Fix #123: ...")

### 5. Keeping Your Branch Updated

Regularly update your branch with changes from the main repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/tradingplatform/trading-platform.git
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

Resolve any conflicts that may arise.

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Submitting a Pull Request

When your changes are ready for review:

1. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Go to the original repository on GitHub and create a Pull Request
3. Provide a clear description of your changes and why they're needed
4. Reference any related issues

### 2. Pull Request Template

Your pull request description should include:

- **Purpose**: What does this PR do?
