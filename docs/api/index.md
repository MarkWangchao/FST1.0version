# API Documentation

## Overview

This section provides comprehensive documentation for the trading platform's API. The API allows developers to programmatically interact with the trading platform, enabling the creation of custom trading solutions, integration with external systems, and automation of trading strategies.

## Contents

- [API Endpoints](endpoints.md) - Detailed documentation of all available API endpoints
- [Authentication](#authentication) - Information about authentication methods and requirements
- [Rate Limiting](#rate-limiting) - Details about rate limiting policies
- [Error Handling](#error-handling) - Standard error codes and handling practices
- [API Versioning](#api-versioning) - Information about API versioning policy

## Authentication

The API uses API keys for authentication. To obtain an API key:

1. Log in to your trading platform account
2. Navigate to the API settings section
3. Generate a new API key
4. Store your API key securely - it will only be displayed once

All API requests must include the API key in the header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Rate Limiting

To ensure system stability and fair usage, the API implements rate limiting. Rate limits are applied based on the API key and vary depending on your account type:

- **Standard accounts**: 60 requests per minute
- **Premium accounts**: 300 requests per minute
- **Enterprise accounts**: Custom limits

When a rate limit is exceeded, the API will return a 429 Too Many Requests response.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests:

- 2xx: Success
- 4xx: Client error (e.g., invalid input, authentication error)
- 5xx: Server error

All error responses include a JSON body with additional information:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "insufficient_funds",
    "message": "Not enough balance to execute this trade",
    "details": {
      "required_amount": "100.00",
      "available_amount": "50.00"
    }
  }
}
```

## API Versioning

The API uses date-based versioning. The version is specified in the URL:

```
https://api.tradingplatform.com/v2023-01-01/orders
```

We maintain backward compatibility within a major version. Breaking changes are introduced with a new major version.
