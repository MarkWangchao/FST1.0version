## Strategy Basics

### What is a Trading Strategy?

A trading strategy is a systematic approach to buying and selling assets based on predefined rules. These rules can be based on:

- **Technical Analysis**: Using price patterns, indicators, and chart formations
- **Fundamental Analysis**: Using economic data, company metrics, or market news
- **Statistical Analysis**: Using mathematical models and statistical patterns
- **Machine Learning**: Using AI to identify patterns and make predictions

### Strategy Components

Every strategy consists of:

1. **Entry Rules**: Conditions for opening a position
2. **Exit Rules**: Conditions for closing a position
3. **Position Sizing**: How much capital to allocate per trade
4. **Risk Management**: Stop-loss, take-profit, and other risk controls
5. **Timeframe**: The time interval for analysis (1-minute, hourly, daily, etc.)

## Using Strategy Templates

Our platform offers pre-built strategy templates that you can customize:

### Accessing Templates

1. Navigate to "Strategies" > "Create New Strategy"
2. Select "Use Template" to view available templates
3. Choose a template that matches your trading style

### Popular Templates

- **Moving Average Crossover**: Buy when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, sell when it crosses below
- **RSI Oversold/Overbought**: Buy when RSI is below 30 (oversold), sell when RSI is above 70 (overbought)
- **Bollinger Band Breakout**: Buy when price breaks above the upper band, sell when it breaks below the lower band
- **MACD Divergence**: Trade based on MACD histogram divergence from price
- **Multiple Indicator Consensus**: Combine multiple indicators for stronger signals

### Customizing Templates

After selecting a template:

1. Adjust the input parameters (e.g., moving average periods, RSI thresholds)
2. Configure position sizing and risk parameters
3. Select the markets to trade
4. Set execution preferences (market vs. limit orders, etc.)
5. Save your customized strategy

## Custom Strategy Development

For advanced users, our platform supports custom strategy development:

### Strategy Builder

Use our visual Strategy Builder to create strategies without coding:

1. Navigate to "Strategies" > "Create New Strategy" > "Strategy Builder"
2. Drag and drop components from the toolbox
3. Connect components to build your strategy logic
4. Configure each component's parameters
5. Test and refine your strategy

### Python Strategy Development

For maximum flexibility, develop strategies using Python:

1. Navigate to "Strategies" > "Create New Strategy" > "Custom Code"
2. Use our Python code editor with syntax highlighting and auto-completion
3. Leverage our strategy API to access market data and execute trades
4. Import custom libraries for advanced analysis
5. Use our debugging tools to test your code

### Example Python Strategy

Here's a simple moving average crossover strategy in Python:

```python
from platform import Strategy, MA

class SimpleMAStrategy(Strategy):
    def init(self):
        # Define parameters
        self.short_period = self.param('short_period', 10)
        self.long_period = self.param('long_period', 30)
        
        # Calculate indicators
        self.short_ma = self.MA(self.close, self.short_period)
        self.long_ma = self.MA(self.close, self.long_period)
    
    def next(self):
        # If not in a position and short MA crosses above long MA
        if not self.position and self.short_ma[-1] <= self.long_ma[-1] and self.short_ma[0] > self.long_ma[0]:
            self.buy()
        
        # If in a long position and short MA crosses below long MA
        elif self.position.is_long and self.short_ma[-1] >= self.long_ma[-1] and self.short_ma[0] < self.long_ma[0]:
            self.close()
```

For a complete reference, see our [API Documentation](../api/strategy_api.md).

## Backtesting

Before deploying a strategy, always backtest it against historical data:

### Running a Backtest

1. Create and configure your strategy
2. Navigate to the "Backtest" tab
3. Set the backtest parameters:
   - **Start Date**: Beginning of the backtest period
   - **End Date**: End of the backtest period
   - **Initial Capital**: Starting capital for the simulation
   - **Commission**: Trading fees to simulate
   - **Slippage**: Price slippage to simulate
4. Click "Run Backtest" to execute the simulation

### Analyzing Backtest Results

The backtest report includes:

- **Performance Metrics**: Total return, annualized return, Sharpe ratio, drawdown
- **Trade Statistics**: Win rate, profit factor, average win/loss
- **Equity Curve**: Visual representation of account growth
- **Trade List**: Detailed list of all simulated trades
- **Risk Analysis**: Risk-adjusted metrics and exposure analysis

### Improving Backtest Accuracy

For more realistic backtests:

- Use appropriate historical data that matches your trading timeframe
- Include realistic trading costs (commission, slippage, funding rates)
- Consider survivorship bias when testing on multiple markets
- Use walk-forward testing to reduce curve-fitting
- Test your strategy under different market conditions

## Strategy Optimization

Refine your strategy through optimization:

### Parameter Optimization

1. Navigate to the "Optimize" tab for your strategy
2. Select parameters to optimize and their ranges
3. Choose an optimization method:
   - **Brute Force**: Test all parameter combinations
   - **Genetic Algorithm**: Evolutionary approach for efficient search
   - **Walk-Forward**: Optimize on in-sample data, validate on out-of-sample
4. Define the optimization objective (e.g., maximize Sharpe ratio)
5. Run the optimization process

### Analyzing Optimization Results

The optimization report shows:

- Performance metrics for all tested parameter combinations
- 3D visualization of parameter performance landscape
- Stability analysis of different parameter regions
- Sensitivity analysis for each parameter
- Recommended parameter sets

### Avoiding Over-Optimization

To prevent curve-fitting:

- Use in-sample/out-of-sample validation
- Prefer robust parameter ranges over exact values
- Focus on parameters that show stable performance across markets
- Consider Monte Carlo simulations to test robustness
- Use fewer parameters when possible

## Risk Management

Implement proper risk management in your strategies:

### Position Sizing Methods

Configure how much capital to risk per trade:

- **Fixed Size**: Always trade a fixed position size
- **Percentage of Capital**: Risk a percentage of your total capital
- **Volatility-Based Sizing**: Adjust position size based on market volatility
- **Kelly Criterion**: Optimize position size based on win rate and win/loss ratio
- **Fixed Risk**: Size positions to risk a fixed amount per trade

### Stop-Loss Strategies

Protect your capital with stop-loss orders:

- **Fixed Stop-Loss**: Set stop-loss at a fixed percentage or amount
- **Indicator-Based Stop**: Set stop-loss based on an indicator (e.g., ATR)
- **Chart Pattern Stop**: Set stop-loss based on support/resistance levels
- **Trailing Stop**: Adjust stop-loss as the trade moves in your favor
- **Time-Based Stop**: Exit a trade after a specific duration

### Portfolio Management

Manage risk across multiple strategies:

- **Diversification**: Trade uncorrelated markets and strategies
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze strategy correlation to build a balanced portfolio
- **Capital Allocation**: Distribute capital optimally across strategies
- **Risk Parity**: Allocate capital based on risk contribution
